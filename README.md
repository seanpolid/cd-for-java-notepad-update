<h1>Overview</h1>
I am not the creator of most of the code found in this repository. The original project can be found <a href="https://github.com/jorgeacetozi/notepad">here</a>. The goal is to provide an updated version of the application that accompanies the book "Continuous Delivery for Java Apps" since part of it is broken due to deprecated libraries. If you're not familiar with the book, I highly recommend it. It covers / uses the following:
<br /> <br />
<ol>
  <li>Docker for containerization</li>
  <li>Flywheel for database migrations</li>
  <li>Gatling for performance tests</li>
  <li>Unit, integration, acceptance, and smoke tests</li>
  <li>Maven for building and running each type of test above</li>
  <li>Jenkins</li>
  <li>Kubernetes</li>
  <li>And more!</li>
</ol>
