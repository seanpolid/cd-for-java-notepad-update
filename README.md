<h1>Overview</h1>
I am not the creator of most of the code found in this repository. The original project can be found <a href="https://github.com/jorgeacetozi/notepad">here</a>. The goal of this repository is to provide an updated version of the application that accompanies the book since part of it is broken due to deprecated libraries. If you're not familiar with the book, I highly recommend it. It covers / uses the following:
<br /> <br />
<ol>
  <li>Docker for containerization</li>
  <li>Flywheel for database migrations</li>
  <li>Gatling for performance tests</li>
  <li>Unit tests and integration tests</li>
  <li>Jenkins</li>
  <li>Kubernetes</li>
  <li>And more!</li>
</ol>
